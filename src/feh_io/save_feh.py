"""
Functions for saving DYNASIM-FEH output files.

DYNASIM FEH produces three files:

    - header file,
    - family file, and
    - person file.


The header file contains specifications of both family and person
records. The function that reads DYNASIM data is read_feh_data_file. 
It requires paths to a header file and to one of the two data files.
