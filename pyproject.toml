# Setup file to instantiate installation of package from command line. setup.py is deprecated

# Update file with new version every time it is updated:
# - version="1.0.0" -> version="1.0.1" for a small change that patches bugs that do not alter compatability
# - version="1.0.0" -> version="1.1.0" for a minor change that adds new features but does not break compatability
# - version="1.0.0" -> version="2.0.0" for a major change that breaks compatability with the previous version
